# ## Python Warmup

# ### Useful functions:

# Before we begin, we want to highlight some functions that you may find useful in this assignment. The last one we'll explore in more depth as well.
# * `np.zeros([dimensions])` - create an array filled with all zeros. 
#     *Ex: `n = np.zeros([9,10,10])` creates a (9,10,10) array of all zeros
# * `np.ones([dimensions])` - same thing as `np.zeros` but with all ones.
# * `np.empty([dimensoons])` - same thing as `np,zeros` but fills array with garbage. Very fast compared to the above.
# * `np.roll(x,shift,axis)` - shift array `x` by `shift` along `axis`.

# ### Warmup - using `np.roll`

# Something we'll see later in this assignment is the need to shift elements right,left,up,down, and diagonally. Let's make a little test problem to illustrate how this works.

# In[3]:


# Run me!
x = np.arange(15).reshape(3,5)
print(x)


# Now we'll want to shift every element in `x` to the right, where we wrap everything around the edge. Rather than figuring this out with a for loop, we'll employ `np.roll` to do it fast!

# In[4]:


print(x,'\n')
print(np.roll(x,(0,1),(0,1)))


# Now let's disect that command. The first `(0,1)` means don't shift the "y" direction, and to shift the "x" direction by +1. The next command `(0,1)` means to apply the shift to the two axes.  
# Now let's go left:

# In[5]:


print(x,'\n')
print(np.roll(x,(0,-1),(0,1)))


# ---
# ðŸ¦‰ Now we'll try to implement a section of the Cha-Cha Slide([Lyrics](https://genius.com/Dj-casper-cha-cha-slide-lyrics))
# ```
# â™«Now it's time to get funky
# To the right now, to the left
# Take it back now y'allâ™ª
# ```
# 
# Make your `x` array go right, then left, then "down". Your output should be:
# ```
# [[ 4  0  1  2  3]
#  [ 9  5  6  7  8]
#  [14 10 11 12 13]]
# [[ 1  2  3  4  0]
#  [ 6  7  8  9  5]
#  [11 12 13 14 10]]
# [[ 5  6  7  8  9]
#  [10 11 12 13 14]
#  [ 0  1  2  3  4]]
# ```
# (Notice how down isn't what you may expect...)

# In[6]:


#!Start
print(np.roll(x,(0,1),(0,1)))
print(np.roll(x,(0,-1),(0,1)))
print(np.roll(x,(-1,0),(0,1)))
#!Stop


# ðŸ¦‰In a special version of the song, the next line goes
# ```
# â™« Take it diagonally up and to the right now y'all
# ```
# Implement this array move, you should get:
# ```
# [[14 10 11 12 13]
#  [ 4  0  1  2  3]
#  [ 9  5  6  7  8]]
#  ```

# Now you're a ~~Cha-Cha Slide~~ `np.roll` master!

# ## Exercise 1: Fluid Dynamics 

# * **List of collaborators:**
# 
# * **References you used in developing your code:**

# In this assignment you will produce a fluid dynamics simulations.  We are going to develop a number of functions which you will store in the cell below (as well as some global variables that we will use throughout this exercise). 
# 
# The global variables are
# ```python
# nx=520; ny=180 #size of our simulation
# ```

# <div class="alert alert-danger" style="color:black">
# 
# If you have a function that takes in an array <code>n</code>, always make a new variable to return:
# ```python
# def doMath(n):
#     # nout = n.copy() #notice the .copy(), so that they aren't the same object
#     nout = 2*n+5
#     return nout
# ```
# 
# </div>

# ### a.  Making some obstacles

# To simulate the real world on the computer, we'll break the tunnel into $n_x\times n_y$ squares which we'll call *voxels*.  
# 
# 
# Your simulation will be doing fluid dynamics in a $n_x \times n_y$ "tunnel" which has some objects within it.  These objects will be represented by a boolean $n_x \times n_y$ size array `obstacle=np.empty((nx,ny),dtype='bool')` which should be `True` where the obstacle is and `False` otherwise. For example, 
# ```python
# obstacle[:,:]=False
# obstacle[50:70,50:70]=True
# ```
# would set up a square $20 \times 20$ object inside our tunnel. 
# 
# ðŸ¦‰Add a `GenerateCylinderObstacle()`  function to the "function-cell" above which generates a object which is a cylinder located at $(n_x/4,n_y/2)$ with a radius of $n_y/9$
# 
# If you do `plt.matshow(GenerateCylinderObstacle())` it should look like this
#

# <b>Do not use the word <code>object</code> as a variable!</b> <br />Notice how <code>object</code> is green in a cell - this means it is a special keyword.<br />

## Call your function here to see if if works. 
plt.matshow(GenerateCylinderObstacle().transpose())
plt.title("Cool Name plot")
#plt.savefig("images/object.png")
plt.show()
            


# ## b.  Microscopic velocities $v_i$

# To simulate the real world on the computer, we'll break the tunnel into $n_x\times n_y$ squares which we'll call *voxels*.
# 
# The key quantity in your simulation is  nine microscopic degrees of freedom 
# * $n_k(i,j)$ where $0\leq k \leq 8$ and $(i,j)$ are over the $n_x \times n_y$ voxels of your simulation
# 
# which are going to be nine different densities (for each voxel $(i,j)$) which correspond to the density of a fluid at $(i,j)$ moving in nine different directions (or velocities $v_k$):
# * $n_0$: stationary fluid moving at velocity $v_0=(0,0)$
# * $n_1$: fluid moving up moving at velocity $v_1=(0,1)$
# * $n_2$: fluid moving down at velocity $v_2=(0,-1)$
# * $n_3$: fluid moving right at velocity $v_3=(1,0)$
# * $n_4$: fluid moving left at velocity $v_4=(-1,0)$
# * $n_5$: fluid moving left-down at velocity $v_5=(-1,-1)$
# * $n_6$: fluid moving left-up at velocity $v_6=(-1,1)$
# * $n_7$: fluid moving right-down at velocity $v_7=(1,-1)$
# * $n_8$: fluid moving right-up at velocity $v_8=(1,1)$
#     
# It will be useful to have access to these microscopic velocities as global variables.  ðŸ¦‰**Go ahead and add to the top of your "function-cell" the various velocities:**
# ```python
# v=np.zeros((9,2),dtype='int')
# v[0,:]=[0,0]
# v[1,:]=[0,1]
# ...
# ```
# 
# **Plot these (below) as**
# ```python
# for i in range(0,9):
#     plt.arrow(0,0,v[i,0],v[i,1],head_width=0.05, head_length=0.1, fc='k', ec='k')
# plt.xlim(-1.2,1.2)
# plt.ylim(-1.2,1.2)
# plt.show()
# ```
# and make sure it looks like

## Plot your microscopic velocities

for i in range(0,9):
    plt.arrow(0,0,v[i,0],v[i,1],head_width=0.05, head_length=0.1, fc='k', ec='k')
plt.xlim(-1.2,1.2)
plt.ylim(-1.2,1.2)
#plt.savefig("images/densityDirection.png")
plt.show()


# We will represent the microscopic densities by a variable 
# * `n=np.zeros(9,nx,ny)`
# 
# 
# The high level algorithm for fluid dynamics is very simple.  After setting up the initial conditions, we loop many times doing
# * Adjust boundary conditions
# * Collide the microscopic densities
# * Move the microscopic densities
# 

# ### c. Computing macroscopic quantities from the microscopic density

# Given the microscopic densities, there are two macroscopic quanties:
# * the macroscopic density $\rho(i,j)=\sum_k n_k$ (*size: $n_x \times n_y$*)
# * the macroscopic velocity $\vec{u}(i,j) \equiv (u_x(i,j),u_y(i,j)$ (*size: $2 \times n_x \times n_y$*) where
#     * $u_x(i,j) = 1/\rho \sum_k v_{k,x}\, n_k(i,j)$ 
#     * $u_y(i,j) = 1/\rho \sum_k v_{k,y}\, n_k(i,J)$
# 
# which you will compute using the function (you will write) `(rho,u) = Micro2Macro(n)`
# 
# ðŸ¦‰Go ahead and write this function and add it to your 'function-cell' 
# 
# You can test it using these lines of code:
# ```python
# testFunc(Micro2Macro,["Microscopic.dat"],["rho_after_Micro2Macro.dat","u_after_Micro2Macro.dat"])
# ```
# and see if it print two zeros (which is a success!)

# **Tip:** Because `u` is $(2,n_x,n_y)$, we can get `ux` by doing `u[0]` (which is then a $(n_x,n_y)$ array) and `uy` by doing `u[1]`.

# #### optional - `np.einsum`

# Figuring out the summations effeciently can be a pain, but we can use [`np.einsum`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.einsum.html) help out here. Figure out how to rewrite the above problem with einstein summation notation. To use the function, if we have 
# $$
# A_{ijk}\cdot B_{dk} = C_{ijd},
# $$
# we'd use then call:
# ```python
# C = np.einsum("ijk,dk->ijd",A,B)
# ```

# #### Test:

# In[12]:


#!Start
#import pickle
#np.random.seed(30)
#microscopicDensity=np.random.random((9,nx,ny))
#pickle.dump( microscopicDensity, open( "Microscopic.dat", "wb" ) )
#(rho,u)=Micro2Macro(microscopicDensity)
#pickle.dump( rho, open( "rho_after_Micro2Macro.dat", "wb" ) )
#pickle.dump( u, open( "u_after_Micro2Macro.dat", "wb" ) )
#!Stop
testFunc(Micro2Macro,["Microscopic.dat"],["rho_after_Micro2Macro.dat","u_after_Micro2Macro.dat"])


# ### d. Getting the equilibrium microscopic densities. 

# 
# Given the macroscopic densities $\rho$ and $\vec{u}$, there is a *equilibrium* microscopic densities $n_{eq}$ (*size: $9 \times n_x \times n_y$*) which you will compute using `n_eq=Macro2Equilibrium(rho,u,obstacle)`
# 
# The relevant formula for this is 
# 
# $$ n^{eq}(v_k) \equiv n_k^{eq} =  \omega_k \rho \left(1 + 3 \vec{v_k} \cdot \vec{u} + \frac{9}{2}(\vec{v_k} \cdot \vec{u})^2- \frac{3}{2}(\vec{u}\cdot \vec{u}) \right)  \tag{A} $$
# 
# where 
# * $\omega_{0}=4/9$
# * $\omega_{1-4}=1/9$ 
# * $\omega_{5-8}=1/36$
# 
# Given some microscopic densities $n$ you should be able then to figure out the equilibrium microscopic densities $n_{eq}$.  
# 
# ðŸ¦‰Write the functions `Macro2Equilibrium` adding them to your "function-cell"
# 
# You can test it by checking if 
# ```python
# testFunc(Macro2Equilibrium,["rho_after_Micro2Macro.dat","u_after_Micro2Macro.dat"],["Microscopic_after_equilibrium.dat"])
# ```
# is equal to zero.

# #### Test:

# In[13]:


#pickle.dump( microscopicDensity, open( "Microscopic_after_equilibrium.dat", "wb" ) ) #!#
testFunc(Macro2Equilibrium,["rho_after_Micro2Macro.dat","u_after_Micro2Macro.dat"],["Microscopic_after_equilibrium.dat"])


# ### d. Implementing collision

# Once you can compute these quantities, the next step is to implement the collision step.  
# 
# ðŸ¦‰Write a function `Collision(n,obstacle)` which returns the density `n` after collision.  Put it in your function-cell above.
# 
# 
# When we collide the microscopic densities, we get new microscopic densities given as  
# * `nout = n * (1-omega) + omega * neq` 
# 
# Here are the steps for the function:
# 1. Calculate `neq`  
#     a. take the microscopic densities $\rightarrow$ compute the macroscopic density and velocity `(rho,u) = Micro2Macro(n)`  
#     b. take the macroscopic density and velocity $\rightarrow$ compute the equilibrium microscopic densities `neq=Macro2Equilibrium(rho,u)`  
# 2. Calculate `nout = n * (1-omega) + omega * neq`   
#     a. $\omega$ is the viscosity parameter.  We will use $\omega =1.9572953736654806$
# 3. We moved fluid where the obstacle is, so we need to undo this. Reset all `nout` where the obstacle is to be the same as `n` 
# 
# 
# 
# Test with 
# ```python
# testFunc(lambda x: Collision(x,GenerateCylinderObstacle()),["Microscopic.dat"],["Microscopic_after_collision.dat"])
# ```
# 

# #### Test:

# In[14]:


#pickle.dump( Collision(microscopicDensity,GenerateCylinderObstacle()), open( "Microscopic_after_collision.dat", "wb" ) ) #!#

testFunc(lambda x: Collision(x,GenerateCylinderObstacle()),["Microscopic.dat"],["Microscopic_after_collision.dat"])


# ### e. Moving

# We'll now move on to getting the fluid to move. This will be a function called, surprise, `Move(n,obstacle)`. But first we need to helper functions:
# * `Bounce(n,obstacle)`
#     * bounce the velocities - that is every velocity where the obstacle is gets reversed
# * `MoveDensity(n)`
#     * Move all your densities in the direction of the velocity (*hint* the velocity tells you where to move it)
#     * Assume periodic boundary conditions here
# 
# Thus a `Move(n,obstacle)` call is just a `Bounce` then `MoveDensity`. ðŸ¦‰Write this function and test!
# 
# 
# Test:
# ```python
# testFunc(lambda x: Bounce(x,GenerateCylinderObstacle()),["Microscopic.dat"],["Microscopic_after_bounce.dat"])
# 
# testFunc(MoveDensity,["Microscopic.dat"],["Microscopic_after_moveDensity.dat"])
# 
# testFunc(lambda x: Move(x,GenerateCylinderObstacle()),["Microscopic.dat"],["Microscopic_after_move.dat"])
# ```

# In[17]:

# ### f.  Boundary conditions

# In the y-direction, we are just going to assume that the boundary conditions are periodic. For the x-direction, we are going to assign certain boundary conditions on the left and right.  
# 
# Let's call this function `FixBoundary(n,n_init)` which applies these boundary conditions and returns the new density `n`.
# 
# **Left:** we are going to assume that there is a flow - this means that the microscopic densities are the same at each step.  Therefore, what we should do is simply replace the current densities on the left-most row with the initial microscopic densities (`n_init`).
# 
# **Right:** we are going to assume that the gradient is zero - i.e. the important physics has dissapeared by this point.  To do this, we will set 
# 
# ```python
# # loop over all microscopic velocities vL that are going left 
#    nout[vL,-1,:] = nout[vL,-2,:] 
# ```
# *Hint:* there are 3 `vL`s.
# 
# 
# ðŸ¦‰Put all of this together and run the next test!
# 
# Testing:
# ```python
# testFunc(FixBoundary,["Microscopic.dat","Microscopic2.dat"], ["Microscopic_after_boundary.dat"])
# ```
# 

# #### Test:

# In[18]:


#!Start
#microscopicDensity2=np.random.random((9,nx,ny))
#pickle.dump(microscopicDensity2,open( "Microscopic2.dat","wb"))
#pickle.dump( FixBoundary(microscopicDensity,microscopicDensity2), open( "Microscopic_after_boundary.dat", "wb" ) )
#!Stop
testFunc(FixBoundary,["Microscopic.dat","Microscopic2.dat"], ["Microscopic_after_boundary.dat"])


# ### g. Setting up the initial conditions

# We need to generate an initial conditions. The way that we are going to do that is 
# * pick some macroscopic density $\rho$ of size $(n_x,n_y)$ (uniformly equal to 1.0) and a 
# * macroscopic velocity $\vec{u}(i,j)$ (sizes $(2,n_x,n_y)$)
#     *  zero in the x-direction (aka 0)
#     * `0.04*(1.0+1e-4*np.sin(y/(ny)*2*np.pi))` in the y-direction (aka 1). This introduces a very tiny anisotropy to the system.
# * compute the equilibrium density $n_{eq}$ associated with the initial density and velocities.   
# **Use (and return) this as the initial conditions**
# 
# ðŸ¦‰Write a function `Setup()` which returns the initial microscopic densities.  Remember to save this as you will need it to apply your boundary conditions. 
# 
# I get the following when I visualize it as `plt.matshow(Setup()[3].transpose())`
# 
# <div><img src="https://clark.physics.illinois.edu/246img/FD_initialCondition.png" width=800  alt="Answer (start)"></img><br></div>
# 
# A quick test here is just to check that the following:
# ```python
# print("All good?",(np.abs(np.max(Setup())-0.443377991)<1e-5) and ((np.abs(np.min(Setup())-0.0245774711)<1e-5)))
# ```

# #### Test:

# In[19]:


print("All good?",(np.abs(np.max(Setup())-0.443377991)<1e-5) and ((np.abs(np.min(Setup())-0.0245774711)<1e-5)))


# ### h. Putting it all together

# ðŸ¦‰Write a function `Run(steps,record,n,n_init,obstacle)` (up in your function-cell) which takes 
# * the number of steps `steps` you want to run
# * how often you want to `record` the velocity and density
# * the microscopic densities `n` to start running from
# * as well as the initial microscopic densities `n_init` for the boundary conditions (often equal to `n.copy()`) 
# * and the obstacle boolean array.
# 
# Each step consists of:
# 1. Adjust boundary conditions
# 2. Collide the microscopic densities
# 3. Move the microscopic densities
# 
# It should return
# * a list of macroscopic densities `rhos`
# * a list of macroscopic velocities `us`
#     * This will be `u2=`$\sqrt{\vec{u}\cdot\vec{u}}$
#     * To help us later, store these as `u2.transpose()`
# * the last microscopic density `n`
# 
# Now (below) call your `Setup` and `Run` functions. Then plot the final configuration (something like `plt.matshow(us[-1])`).  
# 
# ðŸ¦‰Run for 201 steps recording every 100 steps.

# ### i. Animation

# ðŸ¦‰Now write a function `AnimateMe(us_flat,vMax)` which is going to take a list of velocities `us_flat` (and maximum for the `vMax`) and going to return an animation which is going to be then produced by calling

# anim = AnimateMe(us,vMax)
# HTML(anim.to_jshtml())
# ```
#

# ### j. Speed Test (EC)
# *5 Points*

# Our code for for `%time Run(2000,3000,Setup(),Setup(),GenerateCylinderObstacle())` takes between 45 and 60 seconds. We'll give 5 points if you can make your code faster than 40 seconds runtime (on the server). Warning: we aren't sure this is possible!
